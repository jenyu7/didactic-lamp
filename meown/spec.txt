You should start by making your linked lists work with the following functionality:

    insert nodes at the front
    insert nodes in order
    print the entire list
    find and return a pointer to a node based on artist and song name
    find and return a pointer to the first song of an artist based on artist name
    Return a pointer to random element in the list.
    remove a single specified node from the list
    free the entire list

Then create your array of linked lists for the full program and have the following functions:

    Add song nodes.
    Search for a song given song and artist name (return a pointer).
    Search for an artist (return a pointer).
    Print out all the entries under a certain letter.
    Print out all the songs of a certain artist
    Print out the entire library.
    Shuffle - print out a series of randomly chosen songs.
    Delete a song
    Delete all the nodes.

Files you should have:

    A .c file that contains the main function you use to test all your work
    At least one set of .h/.c files
        For example, you can put your struct definition and your linked list headers in a .h file
        You may also want to set up a .h/.c set for the playlist specific functions and a separate set for the linked list functions.
    A makefile that will compile all the parts of your code and generate a single executable program

You must test all the functions in your main function in order to receive full credit!!!

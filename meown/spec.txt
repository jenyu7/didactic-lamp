You should start by making your linked lists work with the following functionality:
    Return a pointer to random element in the list.
    remove a single specified node from the list
    free the entire list

Then create your array of linked lists for the full program and have the following functions:

    Shuffle - print out a series of randomly chosen songs.
    Delete a song
    Delete all the nodes.
